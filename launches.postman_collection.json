Plug it into your chat and make Async Work a breeze for your team:\\n\\n* 1- Running async Daily Stand-ups, natively integrated in the chat\\n* 2- Cutting unnecessary meetings with more types of recurring check-ins\\n* 3- Spreading love and team recognition with DailyBot Kudos\\n* 4- Socializing better with watercooler prompts and random 1:1 coffees\\n\\nAnd developers can build simple in-chat functions for their day-to-day operations, without the need to learn chat-platform-specific APIs.\\n\\nAvailable on Slack, Discord, MS Teams, G Chat.\\n\\n### **The problem**\\n\\nAsync work is the new way of working for many teams. Most teams use chat in any form with tools like Discord, Slack and others. As chat becomes the main app that workers interact with everyday, it becomes necessary to give it more purposes.\\n\\nNew purposes include workflows like team check-ins, surveys, platform notifications, tools for social engagement, or custom commands to trigger actions.\\n\\nCreating all this setup is a hustle:\\n\\n* 1- You have to use many apps, bots, plugins\\n* 2- There is a lot of context switching, management overhead, more subscription fees, and more app fatigue for workers\\n* 3- Most bots are not designed for protecting security and privacy\\n\\n# **DailyBot is the solution**\\n\\nWe are building the first super-bot for your chat. DailyBot comes with a bunch of use cases and features, all-in-one. Some workflows include:\\n\\n**Check-ins:** track automatically what your team is up to. You can run async and written updates, agile daily stand-ups, retrospectives, or periodic check-ins like 1:1s.\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/06136816-f0a8-4324-8e8b-db4bb9a0aa81)\\n\\n**Kudos**: give kudos and celebrate actions that contribute to better team culture. Create rewards and have fun activities with your team based on our leaderboard.\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/b523b354-332f-4d1e-9617-996320210eb7)\\n\\n**Forms**: create all-purpose forms that people can respond to in chat or on the web. Automate vacation requests, recurring feedback forms, and more.\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/91614956-ebf2-45e0-b746-678fac7349ec)\\n\\n**Custom commands**: create commands to increase your team’s productivity in less than a minute. Virtual coffees, birthday reminders, watercoolers, pomodoro timers, your own chat-ops and more.\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/974d041a-a4b9-4c5a-a1c0-2b810e40ec29)\\n\\n### **Security by design and SOC2 compliance**\\n\\nMost apps take a lot of permissions to access data from your chat. This becomes concerning when you are using dozens of apps to build your team workflows. We are designing DailyBot as a privacy & security first company.\\n\\nDailyBot only requests the minimal API permissions from your chat.

Plug it into your chat and make Async Work a breeze for your team:\\n\\n* 1- Running async Daily Stand-ups, natively integrated in the chat\\n* 2- Cutting unnecessary meetings with more types of recurring check-ins\\n* 3- Spreading love and team recognition with DailyBot Kudos\\n* 4- Socializing better with watercooler prompts and random 1:1 coffees\\n\\nAnd developers can build simple in-chat functions for their day-to-day operations, without the need to learn chat-platform-specific APIs.\\n\\nAvailable on Slack, Discord, MS Teams, G Chat.\\n\\n### **The problem**\\n\\nAsync work is the new way of working for many teams. Most teams use chat in any form with tools like Discord, Slack and others. As chat becomes the main app that workers interact with everyday, it becomes necessary to give it more purposes.\\n\\nNew purposes include workflows like team check-ins, surveys, platform notifications, tools for social engagement, or custom commands to trigger actions.\\n\\nCreating all this setup is a hustle:\\n\\n* 1- You have to use many apps, bots, plugins\\n* 2- There is a lot of context switching, management overhead, more subscription fees, and more app fatigue for workers\\n* 3- Most bots are not designed for protecting security and privacy\\n\\n# **DailyBot is the solution**\\n\\nWe are building the first super-bot for your chat. DailyBot comes with a bunch of use cases and features, all-in-one. Some workflows include:\\n\\n**Check-ins:** track automatically what your team is up to. You can run async and written updates, agile daily stand-ups, retrospectives, or periodic check-ins like 1:1s.\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/06136816-f0a8-4324-8e8b-db4bb9a0aa81)\\n\\n**Kudos**: give kudos and celebrate actions that contribute to better team culture. Create rewards and have fun activities with your team based on our leaderboard.\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/b523b354-332f-4d1e-9617-996320210eb7)\\n\\n**Forms**: create all-purpose forms that people can respond to in chat or on the web. Automate vacation requests, recurring feedback forms, and more.\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/91614956-ebf2-45e0-b746-678fac7349ec)\\n\\n**Custom commands**: create commands to increase your team’s productivity in less than a minute. Virtual coffees, birthday reminders, watercoolers, pomodoro timers, your own chat-ops and more.\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/974d041a-a4b9-4c5a-a1c0-2b810e40ec29)\\n\\n### **Security by design and SOC2 compliance**\\n\\nMost apps take a lot of permissions to access data from your chat. This becomes concerning when you are using dozens of apps to build your team workflows. We are designing DailyBot as a privacy & security first company.\\n\\nDailyBot only requests the minimal API permissions from your chat. It can only process messages that are directed to the bot.\\n\\nWe are SOC2 Type II compliant, giving confidence to small and big companies about our work and data management practices.\\n\\n**Join Us!**\\n\\nGet started for free.

We measure 500+ molecules in your blood to match you with personalized action plans such as dietary, behavioral, and soon, therapeutic intereventions that let you extend your healthy lifespan.\\n\\nHey everyone! We’re Dan and Brent and we’re excited to share what we’ve been working on at [iollo](https://www.iollo.com/?utm_source=bookface).\\n\\n### **The problem**\\n\\nWhen you experience an unusual symptom and visit your doctor, you’re usually asked to take a blood test, where they measure about 10-30 markers for which you probably have to pay expensive fees because you haven't reached your deductible. Though at times useful, you’re then prescribed some medications and given generic recommendations based on your results. But did you know that there is a large collection of molecules that aren't commonly measured in your blood called the metabolome that controls your health and how fast you age, and is approximately 5x more influential than your genetics \\\\[1\\\\]?\\n\\n### **What is the metabolome and why it matters**\\n\\nThe metabolome is made up of molecules called metabolites, which are compounds like sugars (e.g., glucose and fructose), fats (e.g., cholesterol), vitamins (e.g., vitamin B12), hormones (e.g., T3 and T4), inflammatory markers (e.g., uric acid) and many more. So far we’ve identified 40,000+ metabolites \\\\[2\\\\] in the human blood and they’ve been implicated in how you age \\\\[3\\\\] and early signs of 30+ age-related diseases like prostate, breast and colon cancer and many other cancers, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and many more \\\\[4\\\\]. As a bonus, your metabolome can also be used to calculate how fast you’re aging, which is a general indicator of your overall health. The good news is that unlike your genetics, which is fixed from when you’re born, your metabolome can be changed over weeks and months with the right interventions.\\n\\n### **Why we founded iollo and how it can help**\\n\\nCurrent clinical labs measure around 30 out of 40,000+ potential markers in your blood, leaving out valuable health information. Until today, measuring the metabolome was exclusively for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. With iollo, you can finally access metabolomics technology to improve your health and age slower.\\n\\nWe start by measuring 500+ blood metabolites that capture imbalances in your blood that are relevant to how fast you’re aging and your overall health and match you with dietary, behavioral, and soon, therapeutic interventions that benefit you the most.\\n\\n### **How it works**\\n\\n1. Subscribe to iollo\\n2. Receive an at-home microsampling device to painlessly collect a blood sample (see picture below)\\n3. Send your sample back, we then measure 500+ metabolites in your sample\\n4. Based on your blood profile, we match you with dietary, behavioral, and therapeutic (coming soon) action plans\\n5. Repeat to see how fast you’re aging and identify factors in your life that affect your metabolite levels\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64281&key=user_uploads/822976/470ef64c-8221-48bd-96ac-d86b55556392)\\n\\n### **Get the most out of your health data by testing more**\\n\\n**1 test/year**\\n\\n* Get the baseline values of 500+ of your blood metabolites\\n* Compare your values to others and see if it’s within range\\n* Get basic tips on how to improve your metabolite values\\n\\n\\\\\\n**3 tests/year**\\n\\n* Benefits of 1 test/year +\\n* Integration with wearables\\n* Understand how fast you’re aging (slower means better for your health)\\n* See how fast your 500+ metabolites are changing compared to your own initial values (too much change might have implications for your health)\\n* Identify general behaviors that affect your metabolite values and take action\\n\\n\\\\\\n**6 tests/year**\\n\\n* Benefits of 3 tests/year +\\n* Integration with diet logging apps\\n* Identify which of your own personal habits, diet, favorite products, supplements, medications and more impact your rate of aging, changes in your metabolite levels, and overall health\\n* Get action plans that improve your metabolite values, such as dietary and behavioral recommendations\\n\\n\\\\\\n**Custom**\\n\\n* [Reach out to us](mailto:founders@iollo.com) if you want to test more than 6 times/year\\n\\n### **Our ask**\\n\\n* [Pre-order](https://x9mr1i6piic.typeform.com/to/cveunYvB?utm_source=bookface) – to participate in our early access program.

We measure 500+ molecules in your blood to match you with personalized action plans such as dietary, behavioral, and soon, therapeutic intereventions that let you extend your healthy lifespan.\\n\\nHey everyone! We’re Dan and Brent and we’re excited to share what we’ve been working on at [iollo](https://www.iollo.com/?utm_source=bookface).\\n\\n### **The problem**\\n\\nWhen you experience an unusual symptom and visit your doctor, you’re usually asked to take a blood test, where they measure about 10-30 markers for which you probably have to pay expensive fees because you haven't reached your deductible. Though at times useful, you’re then prescribed some medications and given generic recommendations based on your results. But did you know that there is a large collection of molecules that aren't commonly measured in your blood called the metabolome that controls your health and how fast you age, and is approximately 5x more influential than your genetics \\\\[1\\\\]?\\n\\n### **What is the metabolome and why it matters**\\n\\nThe metabolome is made up of molecules called metabolites, which are compounds like sugars (e.g., glucose and fructose), fats (e.g., cholesterol), vitamins (e.g., vitamin B12), hormones (e.g., T3 and T4), inflammatory markers (e.g., uric acid) and many more. So far we’ve identified 40,000+ metabolites \\\\[2\\\\] in the human blood and they’ve been implicated in how you age \\\\[3\\\\] and early signs of 30+ age-related diseases like prostate, breast and colon cancer and many other cancers, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and many more \\\\[4\\\\]. As a bonus, your metabolome can also be used to calculate how fast you’re aging, which is a general indicator of your overall health. The good news is that unlike your genetics, which is fixed from when you’re born, your metabolome can be changed over weeks and months with the right interventions.\\n\\n### **Why we founded iollo and how it can help**\\n\\nCurrent clinical labs measure around 30 out of 40,000+ potential markers in your blood, leaving out valuable health information. Until today, measuring the metabolome was exclusively for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. With iollo, you can finally access metabolomics technology to improve your health and age slower.\\n\\nWe start by measuring 500+ blood metabolites that capture imbalances in your blood that are relevant to how fast you’re aging and your overall health and match you with dietary, behavioral, and soon, therapeutic interventions that benefit you the most.\\n\\n### **How it works**\\n\\n1. Subscribe to iollo\\n2. Receive an at-home microsampling device to painlessly collect a blood sample (see picture below)\\n3. Send your sample back, we then measure 500+ metabolites in your sample\\n4. Based on your blood profile, we match you with dietary, behavioral, and therapeutic (coming soon) action plans\\n5. Repeat to see how fast you’re aging and identify factors in your life that affect your metabolite levels\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64281&key=user_uploads/822976/470ef64c-8221-48bd-96ac-d86b55556392)\\n\\n### **Get the most out of your health data by testing more**\\n\\n**1 test/year**\\n\\n* Get the baseline values of 500+ of your blood metabolites\\n* Compare your values to others and see if it’s within range\\n* Get basic tips on how to improve your metabolite values\\n\\n\\\\\\n**3 tests/year**\\n\\n* Benefits of 1 test/year +\\n* Integration with wearables\\n* Understand how fast you’re aging (slower means better for your health)\\n* See how fast your 500+ metabolites are changing compared to your own initial values (too much change might have implications for your health)\\n* Identify general behaviors that affect your metabolite values and take action\\n\\n\\\\\\n**6 tests/year**\\n\\n* Benefits of 3 tests/year +\\n* Integration with diet logging apps\\n* Identify which of your own personal habits, diet, favorite products, supplements, medications and more impact your rate of aging, changes in your metabolite levels, and overall health\\n* Get action plans that improve your metabolite values, such as dietary and behavioral recommendations\\n\\n\\\\\\n**Custom**\\n\\n* [Reach out to us](mailto:founders@iollo.com) if you want to test more than 6 times/year\\n\\n### **Our ask**\\n\\n* [Pre-order](https://x9mr1i6piic.typeform.com/to/cveunYvB?utm_source=bookface) – to participate in our early access program.

This plus his lab's work on chip-DNA-synthesis, gene editing and stem cell engineering resulted in founding additional application-based companies spanning fields of medical diagnostics ( Knome/PierianDx, Alacris, AbVitro/Juno, Genos, Veritas Genetics ) & synthetic biology / therapeutics ( Joule, Gen9, Editas, Egenesis, enEvolv, WarpDrive ). \\n\\nNizar Batada (Co-Founder and CEO): Nizar is a cancer biologist with over 20 years of experience working in genomics and cancer research. He did his PhD at Stanford and postdoc with George Church. Previously, he was a tenure track group leader at the University of Edinburgh where he directed a research lab that focused on cancer immunology. The current work he is pursuing at EUGIT therapeutics is based on his discovery of a subtype of tumor infiltrating gamma delta T cells that are associated with good clinical outcomes in breast cancer. \",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"tagline\": {\n                    \"value\": \"Engineered cancer fighting gamma delta T-cells for off-the-shelf treatment of cancers\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"created_at\": {\n                    \"value\": \"2022-07-01T19:56:00.640Z\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"company\": {\n                    \"id\": {\n                        \"value\": \"26427\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"name\": {\n                        \"value\": \"EUGIT Therapeutics\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"url\": {\n                        \"value\": \"http://www.eugittx.com\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"slug\": {\n                        \"value\": \"eugit-therapeutics\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"logo\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/9a18666cfb63abc8f282afbdf122d614958c6bfe.png\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"Biotech\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"Therapeutics\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    \"batch\": {\n                        \"value\": \"S2022\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"industry\": [\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"Healthcare\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"Healthcare -> Therapeutics\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"user\": {\n                    \"name\": {\n                        \"value\": \"Nizar Batada\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"avatar\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/010cccf95de583e42aa786b127aba55855ccf3d5.jpg\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    }\n                },\n                \"total_vote_count\": {\n                    \"value\": \"9\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"_tags\": [\n                    {\n                        \"value\": \"ycdc_public\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 64273,\n            \"title\": \"⚡️ Integrated Reasoning - Fast hardware for optimization problems\",\n            \"body\": \"**Problem:**\\n\\nLogistics is expensive.\\n\\nImagine you’re a shipping company.

multi-chain NFT ticketing platform that allows anyone to discover, create, manage, and attend events using pre-existing NFTs or new NFTs issued directly from our website.\\n\\n**Why we built NFT Access**\\n\\nIn short, traditional ticketing systems are tangled with inherent problems. Fraud is rampant, attendees that purchase tickets on the resale market often can't separate authentic tickets from fake ones and if they're able to purchase from authorized issuers the fees can cost up to 30% - 40% of face value. A traditional ticket has no use past the original event.

Fraud is rampant, attendees that purchase tickets on the resale market often can't separate authentic tickets from fake ones and if they're able to purchase from authorized issuers the fees can cost up to 30% - 40% of face value. A traditional ticket has no use past the original event. We believe NFTs should serve the purpose of reusable general access tokens.\\n\\nThe event hosts have no benefit from the resale of their tickets, have no way to get data of the attendee if the ticket was resold, and the costs associated with issuing tickets is high. NFTs serving as tickets brings more revenue to artists, creatives and event hosts in the form of royalties from sales on the resale market, reduced production cost ( event can be created, new NFTs issued and ready to sell in under 5 minutes ), and prevents fake tickets because the blockchain provides us a trusted decentralized source for authentication.\\n\\n**Solution - NFT Access**\\n\\nOn NFT Access anyone can create an event.

As a result, turning your data into knowledge is slow and error-prone.\\n\\n​\\n\\n## 📍 **Example use cases**\\n\\nWe believe that the best explanation of Enso business applications is by providing a few use cases:\\n\\n* **Data Quality Management.** E.g. We’re working on a pilot with a bank. Their business users (they've got 10k of them) are defining Data Quality Rules by filling up specially prepared Excel files. Then, data analysts are picking up the Excel files, manually translating them to SQL queries, applying to sample data, and sending them back. After a seemingly infinite ping-pong, the Excel is sent to the Data Science team which translates it to Python scripts to start the data cleansing process. We are planning to replace this whole process, which will shorten the development of a new Data Quality Rule from 90 to 30 days.\\n* **Process automation.** E.g. We're talking with a drug discovery company, a company researching new genome editing processes. They have tons of docker images containing algorithms, like DNA sequencing, or CRISPR design. Their scientists are defining the order the programs should be executed and how the data should be passed between them by manually writing XML files. Enso can provide them with a visual way of building such workflows with a live preview of the results.\\n* **Ad-hoc data analysis.** E.g. telecom data analysts are tracking down network coverage errors and are trying to optimize the network redirection process. They need to create custom data queries pretty often to understand the current state of the systems. Enso would allow them to do it interactively and automate the error discovery process.\\n\\n​\\n\\n![](https://enso.org/img/infographics/data-automation.svg)\\n\\n​\\n\\n​\\n\\n## 🙄 **Why do most visual programming languages suck and Enso does not?**\\n\\n**Most visual programming languages suck because they don't let you express abstractions**. Try to build a complex pipeline and you'll end with an unreadable spaghetti of connections. It's like coding a web app in the assembler. I mean, you can do it, but no matter how much time you'd put into that, it will be complex to read, understand and reason about.\\n\\n**Enso is different. It allows you to express abstractions to manage the complexity. As a result, you'd never have more than 10-20 nodes on the stage in Enso** (nodes are hierarchical).

Slack was great for engaging with community members and with early sales. However as community scales Slack becomes this black hole where context becomes lost. Most public communities can’t afford to pay for several hundred/thousand members so they are limited to 10,000 free messages.

Yep, SALES... sometimes a dirty word in the startup community, but read on—it’s not what you think! \\n\\n### **Why Collaboration Sell$**\\n\\nWe founded Accord to solve 2 surprising challenges while scaling sales teams:\\n\\n1. **Buyers don’t want to talk to you**. Today in the B2B world, 95% of the buying process is NOT spent with a seller… leaving you only 5% of their entire process to engage with. How are you supposed to close deals, especially with complex solutions, in this new world?\\n\\nThis is compounded by the major lack of focus on partnering with customers to solve their problems. Sellers aren’t taking into account the needs of modern buyers and how they want to evaluate & purchase. They push customers through a _sales process_ vs guiding them through a _buyer journey_.\\n\\n2. There’s no system to reinforce a collaborative, buyer-first approach – even if you had it all figured out! Nothing exists to map out the ideal process like there is in engineering (Github), Design (Figma), Product (Jira), etc.\\n\\n## **💃 Solution**\\n\\n**Shared workspace between you and your buyer** in order to: a) drive collaboration & focus on buyer’s needs & expectations b) reinforce a repeatable motion that empowers leadership to scale & up-level their team\\n\\nAccord creates a dedicated workspace between buyer & seller with everything needed to build a strong partnership & increase win rates, deal velocity, and time-to-live:\\n\\n1. Shared next steps & milestones to stay aligned together\\n2. Resource hub to avoid sorting through 100+ email threads for a doc\\n3. Stakeholder management to ensure the right ppl are involved at the right time\\n4. All integrated into CRMs like Salesforce for enhanced pipeline insights\\n\\n## **🤔 Interested in reliably hitting revenue goals & building a repeatable GTM motion?**\\n\\nShoot me a note at [ross@inaccord.com](mailto:ross@inaccord.com) or [sign up for a free trial](https://inaccord.com/free-trial) to check it out yourself!\",\n            \"tagline\": \"Accord helps startups from Figma to Stripe hit ARR targets by collaborating with buyers\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2022-06-30T18:48:40.520Z\",\n            \"company\": {\n                \"id\": 13058,\n                \"name\": \"Accord\",\n                \"url\": \"https://inaccord.com\",\n                \"slug\": \"accord\",\n                \"logo\": \"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/3e26c677c431ea29e44d25107bafd6e19ac2839e.png\",\n                \"tags\": [\n                    \"SaaS\",\n                    \"B2B\"\n                ],\n                \"batch\": \"W2020\",\n                \"industry\": [\n                    \"B2B Software and Services\",\n                    \"B2B Software and Services -> Sales\"\n                ]\n            },\n            \"user\": {\n                \"name\": \"Ross Rich\",\n                \"avatar\": \"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/9187282ba47f6f8f1c44751c71dce0fead981ba2.jpg\"\n            },\n            \"total_vote_count\": 18,\n            \"_tags\": [\n                \"ycdc_public\"\n            ],\n            \"objectID\": \"post_64240\",\n            \"_highlightResult\": {\n                \"id\": {\n                    \"value\": \"64240\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"title\": {\n                    \"value\": \"Accord - Win & Onboard Customers Faster\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"body\": {\n                    \"value\": \"We’re building [Accord](https://inaccord.com) with the goal of making B2B Sales suck a lot less for buyers & sellers.

Nothing exists to map out the ideal process like there is in engineering (Github), Design (Figma), Product (Jira), etc.\\n\\n## **💃 Solution**\\n\\n**Shared workspace between you and your buyer** in order to: a) drive collaboration & focus on buyer’s needs & expectations b) reinforce a repeatable motion that empowers leadership to scale & up-level their team\\n\\nAccord creates a dedicated workspace between buyer & seller with everything needed to build a strong partnership & increase win rates, deal velocity, and time-to-live:\\n\\n1. Shared next steps & milestones to stay aligned together\\n2. Resource hub to avoid sorting through 100+ email threads for a doc\\n3. Stakeholder management to ensure the right ppl are involved at the right time\\n4. All integrated into CRMs like Salesforce for enhanced pipeline insights\\n\\n## **🤔 Interested in reliably hitting revenue goals & building a repeatable GTM motion?**\\n\\nShoot me a note at

Alternatively, testing directly on a public testnet involves manual sharing of private keys, which poses security risks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**We’d Love to Hear From You** 🤝\\n\\nEmail us at [jensen@zoltarlabs.com](https://mailto:jensen@zoltarlabs.com) or [james@zoltarlabs.com](https://mailto:james@zoltarlabs.com) if…\\n\\n* You are a blockchain developer and have experienced pain points with the current testing workflow\\n* You are part of a Web3 team and want a more streamlined smart contract development experience\\n\\n### \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Sign up for our beta** [**here**](https://yjmqezl7c95.typeform.com/to/HXkQK50e) **today!**\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"tagline\": {\n                    \"value\": \"🧗 On a mission to create the best developer experience for Web3 native teams\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"created_at\": {\n                    \"value\": \"2022-06-30T02:36:56.264Z\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"company\": {\n                    \"id\": {\n                        \"value\": \"26876\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"name\": {\n                        \"value\": \"Zoltar Labs\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"url\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://www.zoltarlabs.com/\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"slug\": {\n                        \"value\": \"zoltar-labs\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"logo\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/8c6e0f60f05c93e4aa70e811f7fa2df38afbb600.png\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"Developer Tools\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"Crypto / Web3\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    \"batch\": {\n                        \"value\": \"S2022\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"industry\": [\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"B2B Software and Services\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"B2B Software and Services\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"user\": {\n                    \"name\": {\n                        \"value\": \"Jensen Kuo\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"avatar\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/0799a75c6f296b1fa6fa404afaae84abc6b3de26.jpg\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    }\n                },\n                \"total_vote_count\": {\n                    \"value\": \"329\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"_tags\": [\n                    {\n                        \"value\": \"ycdc_public\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 64221,\n            \"title\": \"Theneo - Generate Stripe-like API Docs & Developer Portals\",\n            \"body\": \"Hey there, \\n\\nAna from Theneo.

Slack was great for engaging with community members and with early sales. However as community scales Slack becomes this black hole where context becomes lost. Most public communities can’t afford to pay for several hundred/thousand members so they are limited to 10,000 free messages. You run into the problem of people asking repeat questions and not searching in Slack. It also doesn’t help that the Slack UX encourages posting and not searching. We experimented with Github discussions and Discourse but didn’t want another channel to maintain and split the community on.\\\\\\n\\\\\\n**Solution**\\\\\\nWith Linen I wanted to build a tool that is very low maintenance without changing my current workflow. By making it search engine friendly and putting it on a website the community members can find answers to repeat questions before ever getting into your Slack channel.

However, in its current state, freight forwarding for trucking faces two main challenges:\\n\\n1. _1) Operational Inefficiency —_ There are many phone calls, emails, and f2f conversations in booking trucks for your loads.\\n2. _2) Fragmented Market —_ The top 10 players in trucking account for around 5-6% of the total market size. SME fleets (5-10 trucks) run 90-95% of the market.\\n\\n\\\\\\n**the Solution:**\\\\\\n\\\\\\nWe act as the main point of contact for the shippers and reduce complexity for them.

You can now connect any app, through your heart rate belt, be it from Polar, Suunto, Garmin or anything that supports BLE 🎉🎉\\n\\n* More about Terra [here](https://tryterra.co)\\n* More about the real-time streaming [here](https://blog.tryterra.co/realtime-data-streaming-3db7a5a207ae)\\n* More about the docs [here](https://docs.tryterra.co)\\n* and some [stories](https://blog.tryterra.co/startup-spotlight/home) from our customers\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64219&key=user_uploads/356569/226e3640-0d81-4cc3-a05a-26c352b56fe1)\\n\\n\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"tagline\": {\n                    \"value\": \"New product: Connect your app to real-time wearable data.

Prior to Bend, we worked together at Abacus (W14), a real time expense management company that I cofounded in 2014, serving small businesses. At Abacus, we noticed a pattern: finance teams are increasingly paying attention to the climate impact of their purchase decisions, from travel policies, to cloud hosting, and beyond. And better tooling and data is needed to drive pragmatic, effective climate action. \\n\\n### **From zero to net zero in 5 minutes**\\n\\nHere’s how Bend works:\\n\\n* Bend converts spend data into CO2e data.\\n* For example: imagine a $1,000 bill from Atlassian. Bend aggregates corporate emissions disclosures; we know that for every $1,000 spent with Atlassian, there’s a 30.2 kg footprint.\\n* For long-tail merchants, we have merchant category fallbacks, so you’re always guaranteed 100% coverage (e.g. for Starbucks, we use the Starbucks factor, for a mom-and-pop coffee shop, we use a benchmark ‘coffee shop’ factor).\\n* Our methodology is developed and vetted by climate science PhDs (degrees from MIT, Columbia, etc.), and our team has years of fintech experience (Abacus, Emburse, Google, Venmo).\\n* Once armed with a complete picture of your emissions, you can choose a course of action — you might consider switching to lower-carbon-intensity vendors, offsetting your remaining emissions, and then **closing sales as a sustainable business** (we can help!).\\n\\n![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/8725/339c2757-2d8e-4721-9bdc-d3b996b98c44)\\n\\n### **Why now**\\n\\n* Companies (e.g. Salesforce, Apple, Walmart) now require their suppliers to measure emissions and set reductions targets. Bend can help you sell to these customers.\\n* The SEC is expected to roll out new climate data disclosure requirements this year, applying to public companies, with downstream impacts.\\n* Your company has a surprising amount of leverage to accelerate decarbonization. It’s a great thing to be a part of, and has positive brand benefits for your startup.\\n\\n### **Our ask**\\n\\nTry Bend out!

This becomes concerning when you are using dozens of apps to build your team workflows. We are designing DailyBot as a privacy & security first company.\\n\\nDailyBot only requests the minimal <em>API</em> permissions from your chat. It can only process messages that are directed to the bot.\\n\\nWe are SOC2 Type II compliant, giving confidence to small and big companies about our work and data management practices.\\n\\n**Join Us!**\\n\\nGet started for free. Go to [www.dailybot.com](http://www.dailybot.com) and install DailyBot on your chat (2-min setup). We have a bookface deal for our fellow YC members.\\n\\nSee you on the other side!\\n\\nPs: Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/StjtJ5u7QF) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dailybot) and [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dailybot) ;)\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"full\",\n                    \"fullyHighlighted\": false,\n                    \"matchedWords\": [\n                        \"api\"\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"tagline\": {\n                    \"value\": \"⚡️ On a mission to provide one-click workflows for team collaboration and productivity via chat\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"created_at\": {\n                    \"value\": \"2022-07-04T18:21:28.389Z\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"company\": {\n                    \"id\": {\n                        \"value\": \"24153\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"name\": {\n                        \"value\": \"DailyBot\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"url\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://www.dailybot.com/\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"slug\": {\n                        \"value\": \"dailybot\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"logo\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/8a4562eea5bec9eaf52ff9e3598861ff6e24fdf0.png\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"Developer Tools\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"SaaS\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"Collaboration\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    \"batch\": {\n                        \"value\": \"S2021\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"industry\": [\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"B2B Software and Services\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"value\": \"B2B Software and Services -> Productivity\",\n                            \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                            \"matchedWords\": []\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"user\": {\n                    \"name\": {\n                        \"value\": \"Mauricio Morales\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    },\n                    \"avatar\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/0c8c909c734290d1b7b36a9c93d2c2aa7f12e5c3.jpg\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    }\n                },\n                \"total_vote_count\": {\n                    \"value\": \"23\",\n                    \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                    \"matchedWords\": []\n                },\n                \"_tags\": [\n                    {\n                        \"value\": \"ycdc_public\",\n                        \"matchLevel\": \"none\",\n                        \"matchedWords\": []\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 64303,\n            \"title\": \"Stipop: A must-have sticker feature in modern communication\",\n            \"body\": \"Hi everyone [👋](https://emojipedia.org/waving-hand/#:\\\\~:text=A%20hand%20waving%20most%20commonly,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.)

It allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants (that become donations) to 501(c) charities over time.

Developer-First Content Management System\",\n            \"body\": \"Hey YC,\\n\\nJames, Dan, and Elliot here. We’re three full-stack TypeScript devs that got tired of feeling like second-class citizens when it comes to content management systems—so we built Payload.\\n\\n[**Payload**](https://payloadcms.com) is a truly dev-first, headless content management system aimed sharply at giving engineers the best development experience possible in a noisy ecosystem of tools that often disregard the importance of quality, clean, extensible code.\\n\\n![The Payload Admin UI](https://payloadcms.com/images/admin-laptop.png)\\n\\n### \\n\\n### The Problem\\n\\nTo developers, “content management system” is a swear word.\\n\\n* Devs want to build cutting-edge products that are structured effectively to deliver elegant solutions to their business needs.\\n* Modern teams want to write code in modern languages like TypeScript and React, but most CMS are built with legacy tech and have lasted long past their shelf life.\\n* You will often hit roadblocks with other CMS, and many SaaS options “black-box” functionality away, meaning developers can never truly own their own code.\\n* Devs often undervalue the power that a good CMS _could_ represent. Even web and native apps generally need to manage “content”, like orders, requests, users, profiles, and more—but often, developers roll their own systems for these apps. Time is wasted and the wheel is reinvented from scratch every time.\\n\\nBuilding a project that needs a CMS shouldn’t be a dreaded task for modern developers.\\n\\n### Payload is...\\n\\n**A CMS that is obsessed with giving engineers the best developer experience possible to build out APIs and admin UI.** It catapults developers' efficiency and value by delivering an extensible REST and GraphQL API as well as a beautiful React admin panel for non-technical users to manage content—all in TypeScript.\\n\\nFrom docs to design, it's staunchly code-first, but uncompromising in admin experience. Developers finally have a tool to deliver their admins with a CMS that is beautiful, minimal, extensible, and usable. It can power the backend for websites of all sizes, ecommerce, SaaS, native apps, and more.\\n\\n**Tech specs:**\\n\\n* Completely open-source\\n* [Fully self-hosted](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment)\\n* [GraphQL](https://payloadcms.com/docs/graphql/overview), [REST](https://payloadcms.com/docs/rest-api/overview), and [Local](https://payloadcms.com/docs/local-api/overview) APIs\\n* [Customizable ReactJS Admin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/admin/overview)\\n* [Extensible authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview)\\n* [Local file storage & upload](https://payloadcms.com/docs/upload/overview)\\n* [Field-based localization](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/localization)\\n* [Block-based layout builder](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/blocks)\\n* [Extensible SlateJS rich text editor](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/rich-text)\\n* [Array field type](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/array)\\n* [Field conditional logic](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/overview#conditional-logic)\\n* Extremely granular [Access control](https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview)\\n* [Document and field-level hooks](https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/overview) for every action Payload provides\\n* Built with Typescript & very Typescript-friendly\\n* Highly secure thanks to HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection, and more\\n\\n### What customers say\\n\\n* \\\"This product is a developer's dream come true in the world of CMS.\\\" - Developer, NYC, USA - 12 Oct 2021\\n* \\\"CMS used to be something dreadful, now it's starting to feel right.\\\" - Developer, London, UK - 31 Mar 2021\\n* “Started looking into headless CMS options... Payload was a clear winner.” - Developer, Berlin, Germany - 24 June 2021\\n\\n### Who we are\\n\\nWe're three full-stack engineers that have built digital projects with existing CMS for over a decade—including enterprise websites for big names like Klarna. We knew what we wanted, but also intimately knew it didn't exist—so we built it.\\n\\n### Ask for YC\\n\\n**Have a GitHub account?

We’re three full-stack TypeScript devs that got tired of feeling like second-class citizens when it comes to content management systems—so we built Payload.\\n\\n[**Payload**](https://payloadcms.com) is a truly dev-first, headless content management system aimed sharply at giving engineers the best development experience possible in a noisy ecosystem of tools that often disregard the importance of quality, clean, extensible code.\\n\\n![The Payload Admin UI](https://payloadcms.com/images/admin-laptop.png)\\n\\n### \\n\\n### The Problem\\n\\nTo developers, “content management system” is a swear word.\\n\\n* Devs want to build cutting-edge products that are structured effectively to deliver elegant solutions to their business needs.\\n* Modern teams want to write code in modern languages like TypeScript and React, but most CMS are built with legacy tech and have lasted long past their shelf life.\\n* You will often hit roadblocks with other CMS, and many SaaS options “black-box” functionality away, meaning developers can never truly own their own code.\\n* Devs often undervalue the power that a good CMS _could_ represent. Even web and native apps generally need to manage “content”, like orders, requests, users, profiles, and more—but often, developers roll their own systems for these apps. Time is wasted and the wheel is reinvented from scratch every time.\\n\\nBuilding a project that needs a CMS shouldn’t be a dreaded task for modern developers.\\n\\n### Payload is...\\n\\n**A CMS that is obsessed with giving engineers the best developer experience possible to build out <em>API</em>s and admin UI.** It catapults developers' efficiency and value by delivering an extensible REST and GraphQL <em>API</em> as well as a beautiful React admin panel for non-technical users to manage content—all in TypeScript.\\n\\nFrom docs to design, it's staunchly code-first, but uncompromising in admin experience. Developers finally have a tool to deliver their admins with a CMS that is beautiful, minimal, extensible, and usable. It can power the backend for websites of all sizes, ecommerce, SaaS, native apps, and more.\\n\\n**Tech specs:**\\n\\n* Completely open-source\\n* [Fully self-hosted](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment)\\n* [GraphQL](https://payloadcms.com/docs/graphql/overview), [REST](https://payloadcms.com/docs/rest-<em>api</em>/overview), and [Local](https://payloadcms.com/docs/local-<em>api</em>/overview) <em>API</em>s\\n* [Customizable ReactJS Admin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/admin/overview)\\n* [Extensible authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview)\\n* [Local file storage & upload](https://payloadcms.com/docs/upload/overview)\\n* [Field-based localization](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/localization)\\n* [Block-based layout builder](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/blocks)\\n* [Extensible SlateJS rich text editor](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/rich-text)\\n* [Array field type](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/array)\\n* [Field conditional logic](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/overview#conditional-logic)\\n* Extremely granular [Access control](https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview)\\n* [Document and field-level hooks](https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/overview) for every action Payload provides\\n* Built with Typescript & very Typescript-friendly\\n* Highly secure thanks to HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection, and more\\n\\n### What customers say\\n\\n* \\\"This product is a developer's dream come true in the world of CMS.\\\" - Developer, NYC, USA - 12 Oct 2021\\n* \\\"CMS used to be something dreadful, now it's starting to feel right.\\\" - Developer, London, UK - 31 Mar 2021\\n* “Started looking into headless CMS options... Payload was a clear winner.” - Developer, Berlin, Germany - 24 June 2021\\n\\n### Who we are\\n\\nWe're three full-stack engineers that have built digital projects with existing CMS for over a decade—including enterprise websites for big names like Klarna. We knew what we wanted, but also intimately knew it didn't exist—so we built it.\\n\\n### Ask for YC\\n\\n**Have a GitHub account?
